Finally, you have submitted a transaction to complete your Smart Invoice Registration! We ask that you wait patiently for the transaction to be processed.  

After your transaction has processed, you should see the invoice has been registered.  You can check to see the transaction by clicking just below the “Invoice Registered” header. 
 
Following submission, you will see a copyable link to your Invoice ID as well as a link to your invoice agreement.  

As a provider, send your “Invoice ID” or inform the client that they can input their wallet address into the “View Existing Invoice” tab on smartinvoice.xyz, enabling the Client access to pay the Provider for their services

###### Note: The invoice ID can be used to look up your invoice if you do not have access to the Client’s Wallet Address initially provided.
