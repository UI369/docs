title: Moloch V2 üë∫

UberHaus utilizes the Moloch V2 framework. A great overview of Moloch V2 and it‚Äôs benefits can be found [here - vengist](https://medium.com/raid-guild/moloch-evolved-v2-primer-25c9cdeab455) or [here - spengrag](https://daohaus.mirror.xyz/U_JQtheSzdpRFqQwf9Ow3LgLNG0WMZ6ibAyrjWDu_fc).
 
Moloch was popularized due to its Minimum Viable DAO design and the advent of ‚Äúragequit‚Äù - a means for members to exit the DAO by exchanging their shares for a pro-rata claim on the War Chest‚Äôs assets.
 
The TL;DR of Moloch V2 is that it allows for an optimized War Chest and new Proposal Types. Moloch V2 can hold a variety of ERC20 tokens, and allows for anyone (including those without shares) to make a proposal to the DAO.

Uberhaus uses an upgraded version of the MolochV2 contracts which allow easier DAO2DAO relationships and easier and permissionless onboarding.
