## Step 1: Navigate Existing Invoice(s)

1. Enter Invoice ID or Client Wallet Address
2. Click “Awaiting Deposit” 
	
Here you can see the Invoice name on the left hand side, above the information 
detailed about the invoice.  To the right, you can see payment details such as milestones, amount deposited, amount released, as well as remaining amount due.

## Step 2: Depositing or Releasing Payment

If you would like to **make a deposit**, simply click the deposit button and select each of the milestones that you would like to make a deposit for, then click the deposit button that appears in the pop up.  This will redirect you to your WalletConnect or your MetaMask to approve the transaction.  

After you complete the transaction, you will see “Deposited” and the “Date” indicating that your deposit has been received by the contract.  This does not indicate that the provider has received payment from you, but rather a contract holds the funds you deposited, enabling you to release the funds when the first milestone is reached.

If you would like to **release payment**  to the provider, you can click the release button, which will redirect you to your WalletConnect or MetaMask where you will be asked to approve the transaction. Once the transaction is complete, you will see “Released” and the “Date” indicating that your payment has been received by the client wallet address provided in the Smart Invoice form.
