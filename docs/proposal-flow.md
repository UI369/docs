title: Proposal Flow
---

Before we get to the different types of proposals on UberHaus, we recommend you go through the following that will ensure the greatest chance of success when you go to make an official proposal to UberHaus DAO. 
 
This is the process of receiving soft consensus for what you are proposing. These steps will help you obtain a signal for your idea, and you may possibly receive feedback, suggestions, or additional ideas from DAO delegates!
 
1. Discuss your idea or proposal with other UberHaus delegates or member DAOs. You can propose your idea in the monthly delegates meeting [link](https://discord.com/channels/709210493549674598/827264041835692052/842816158712332378)
2. Select “+ New Topic” in the [UberHaus Forum](https://forum.daohaus.club/c/uberhaus-1-5/261) where you want to introduce your idea and receive feedback from the community.  
3. Create a proposal in [snapshot](https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x64/0x0179fe4758fbec1124995a0cee7b1e713d34bc36/boost/snapshot). Be sure to link to any forum disccusion.
4. A successful proposal will go on to the Federation to ratifyon chain for the DAO to execute.
 
*Note the steps outlined above are not requirements, but they will ensure that your proposal gets more traction and engagement, inevitably leading to higher chance of passing your DAOs proposal.
