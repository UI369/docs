<h4><details>
<summary> What is Arbitration and how does the dispute process work? (CLIENT/PROVIDER) </summary>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

###### Arbitration is a way for the client or provider to enter a dispute against the other party and reach a fair resolution through using a third-party adjudicator. 

###### If the client loses confidence in the provider at any time, they may lock the remaining funds in smart invoice so that they cannot be released or withdrawn.

###### Alternatively, If the client has not released funds once a milestone has been completed, the provider may Lock any remaining funds in smart invoice.

###### In both cases, the lock triggers the arbitration provider (i.e., LexDAO or Custom) to review the dispute. Based on their review, the arbitration provider will determine which party should receive "x" amount of funds, and will send a transaction to the smart invoice contract that will transfer the appropriate amount to each party.
