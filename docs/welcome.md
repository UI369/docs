### Who is PublicHaus?

PublicHaus is the governing framework of the Daohaus ecosystem and protocol

### The goal is to build our HAUS¬è 
 We hope to strengthen and unify the community that see a better future through further research, development and adoption of decentralized and digital coordination.

### High level Framework goals
- **Continued Decentralization** of the protocol by decreasing the central points of failure increasing resiliency and diversity.
- **More autonomy** of the individual through collective curation of strategic objectives that empower tactical execution
- **Reduce Complexity** of governance and operational overhead
- **Dogfood decentralized governance** tools and involve the HAUS holder in future direction of the protocol

Time to slay Moloch together!
