In this step you will enter the following payment details: 

1. Client Address 
2. Service Provider Address 
3. Total Payment Due 
4. Payment Token 
5. Number of Payments 
6. Arbitration Provider 
7. Max Dispute Fee
8. Terms-of-Service


## Step 3: Payment Chunks

1. Enter Payment amount per milestone
2. Enter Amount up until total amount is paid

## Step 4: Create Invoice 
 
Review that all of the details of your invoice are correct, if they are not you will want to re-enter the correct information in each of the fields you filled out incorrectly. 

###### Disclaimer: If you enter the incorrect “Client Address” or if any of the information you provide in the Smart Invoice form is wrong, you will not be able to edit or change that information later.  This is because every completed Smart Invoice form executes on-chain, meaning it cannot be reversed and is immutable.  Therefore, take extra caution and make sure to double or triple check that the details you enter are correct.  

###### Note: By clicking on the “back” tab, you can navigate between previously completed steps in order to review or change any incorrect information inputted into the Smart Invoice form.  (Do not click the back-arrow in the search engine or your previous entries will be lost)
