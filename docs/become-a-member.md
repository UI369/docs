title: Become a Member
---

To become a member see the onboarding flow. this can be done as an individual or a DAO and is the first step to any further proposal types.

## Make Your DAO a Member
 
If you want to join UberHaus as a DAO, there are several things you should do before submitting an official proposal to the DAO.
Visit the [UberHaus Forum](https://forum.daohaus.club/c/uberhaus-1-5/261) and select ‚Äú+ New Topic‚Äù.

This is where you will want to showcase what your DAO can do for UberHaus.

- Share what your DAO or community has previously worked on in the web3 space
- Tell us what your DAO can uniquely do to benefit UberHaus.  
- Tell us why your DAO wants to join UberHaus
- How many Shares is your DAO pledging for?
- If your DAO is pledging for more than 500 shares, tell us why you want to do that.  
- What else should we know about your DAO?

You will need to pledge in HAUS, although if your community has a token that might work as well. What are your ideas here?
 
Remember you can pledge a minimum of **100 HAUS** 
 
*Note: If your DAO does not have the HAUS to pledge for UberHaus membership, their are additional methods of ‚Äúearning‚Äù your way into UberHaus.*
 
To find out more check out the `grants` section under `GettingStarted`
 
 
### Minion Setup
 
If using a daihaus DAO: Before you can pledge and your DAO become a member, you‚Äôll have to setup a Minion to manage your DAOs membership, you can setup a minion from the boost market page.  

Deploy a Safe Minion v3 and give it a early execution quorum. This will allow your dao to execute on proposal voting faster and without the full voting/grace requirments of the main treasury.

The next step is for you to make a proposal to Stake Haus into the UberHaus onboarding flow, but before you can make a proposal you need to get your DAO and minion ready to work with HAUS.  
 
1. Approve HAUS in your DAO by making a ‚ÄúToken Proposal‚Äù and whitelisting the address by entering the token contract address in the field ‚ÄúToken Address‚Äù
2. Send HAUS to your Minion‚Äôs Address (found just üëá)
 
Now your DAO and Minion are ready to go. 

After this setup you can fow the proposal flow/types documentation
