### Summon Your DAO on xDAI

HAUS lives on xDAI, which means if you want to participate in PublicHaus governance, it will have to be summoned or cloned onto the xDAI network.  
 
HAUS selected xDAI for its low transaction costs and its robust network as an Ethereum side-chain.  
 
If you wish to clone a your DAO on xDAI, reach out in our discord <span class='channels'>#support</span> to get some help getting your DAO cloned.
