title: UberHaus Shares
---
 
All Shares are non-transferable and unique to the DAO being used (in this case UberHaus).
 
Each share represents a pro-rata claim on the underlying capital pool and can be exchanged at any time using the Ragequit feature.
 
There is no cap on the amount of shares that can be issued, and each share carries one vote.
 
All new shares are issued at a rate of 1 HAUS/share and new members may request a maximum of x shares when joining.
 
### Non-Voting Shares
 
Loot, or non-voting shares are similar to normal shares in that they can be Rage Quit to withdraw an amount proportional to your DAOs pro-rata claim on the UberHaus assets held by the DAO Bank.  For instance, if you're requesting funding for work that you completed you may request Loot > wxDAI for that work.
