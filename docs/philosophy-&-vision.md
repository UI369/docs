UberHaus believes DAOs of all types can contribute value, and the main question UberHaus begs that your DAO consider is, What can your DAO do for UberHaus?
 
This question is a core principle to several of the DAOs operating on DAOhaus today, and it serves as guidance to individual contributors of many types, keeping DAOhaus lean and mean in its unified pursuit aimed at defeating Moloch.  
 
UberHaus is committed to upholding the tradition of transparency through actively educating and disseminating information about the processes, discussions, and progress that UberHaus makes through fulfilling its purpose.
 
UberHaus is charged with laying the foundation for DAO2DAO relations.  It is with great passion that UberHaus will look to serve the wider DAOhaus ecosystem and unify all of their constituent parts under one cohesive system, a "DAO of DAOs".
 
UberHaus is looking to achieve it's wider goals of exiting to the community, this means decentralizing as much of the DAOhaus platform as quickly and as safely as possible for it be the first DAO platform completely run by DAOs.
 
Time to slay Moloch together! ⚔️
